SMIL/Timing and Timesheets are an easy and efficient way to sync an HTML
slideshow with an audio track.

This slideshow is an HTML version of [this
presentation](http://commonspace.wordpress.com/2011/01/12/joinmozilla/) of the
[Join Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/join) program by Mark Surman. Mark has
published his slides as a video, we’re taking it a bit further by keeping the
content in HTML (accessibility, indexability…) and sync’ing it with his audio
track.
